# Missing Number

Create a function that takes an array of numbers between 1 and 10 (excluding one number) and returns the missing number.

Example IO:
```
missingNum([7, 2, 3, 6, 5, 9, 1, 4, 8])
=> 10
```

Notes
* The array of numbers will be unsorted (not in order).
* Only one number will be missing.
